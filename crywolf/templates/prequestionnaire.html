            <p>Your participation in this experiment is voluntary. You may refuse to participate or may refuse to answer 
                any questions. You may stop at any time without penalty. The data you provide will be 
                kept secure once it is in the researcher’s possession. However, the researcher cannot 
                guarantee security during transmission of data due to keylogging or other spyware that 
                may exist on the computer you are using. Software will also be used to record your monitor’s 
                display during the conduct of this experiment.</p>
            <p>Please answer each of the following questions.</p>
